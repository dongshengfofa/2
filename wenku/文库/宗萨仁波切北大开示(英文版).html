View is what drives us. Before discussing the Views, l will talk about why Buddhism; like we discuss anything else, we must ask why this thing is needed at first. The reason is simple, because everyone wants fun, to be happy; moreover, we want fun that will last long and also is cheap. We also want a fun, which is portable. In fact, science and technology are also always looking for fun. What is fun? It differs, among different human beings, different cultures and generations. Therefore, the methods/tools to acquire fun have varieties. Prince Siddhartha </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（悉达多太子）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>has found that we are not as fun as we want because of one reason: we look at something which is fake, unreliable and uncertain; then we think it is absolute truth. This is ignorance</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（无明）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>. This finding is not religious-it is science. It is like everyone wants genuine Italian leather shoes</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（意大利真皮皮鞋）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>, but you bought fake leather shoes, and you just don</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">’</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>t have the courage to face it; but Prince Siddhartha has the courage to face it. We may say that Prince Siddhartha made the biggest request for truth-to solve the problem of sickness and death. And he found the truth-you must accept the truth; if you accept, you won’t suffer. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Unfortunately, Buddhism has now become a religion, and people are attracted to the methods </SPAN><FONT face="Times New Roman"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（修行的方法）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>rather than the truth. Why should there be tools/methods? For example, for a glass filled with absolutely pure water full to the brim, if you are looking for the water, you can’t see water because it is pure. The water is like the truth. Then to make you see the water, someone dilutes it, just like this yellowish color (</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">指桌上的茶水</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>), which helps you see the water.

However, we get attracted to the color. Why did Prince Siddhartha teach so many schools </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（教派）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>? It is just like if you are forced to say that sky is red or green under gun threat, you have to agree sky is red or green, although inside you know it is not. The same way, it is because Buddha has no choice but to teach so many schools-although without gun threat, he still has no choice; because he has great compassion </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（慈悲）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>. For example, you are dreaming; you are having a nightmare. You dream about a tiger, you are frantic; you want to get out of it. There are several things can be done. The first one is to chase away the tiger. The second, you get a bucket of cold water. These things help, but they are wrong. The cold water can’t chase away the tiger. Why is there tiger? It is because you are dreaming.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Views are ideas. They are what drive us, just like in everything, we have a driving force.

This is a view. Then we have motivation, but the motivation is conditional. Without the magazines saying that they are good things, nobody wants to be slim, or want a BMW. Under this condition, we have the motivation, for example, of being slim. Then we read about how to being slim-this is like mediation</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">（冥想，静修）</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>.

Why? It is because they make us to think that a thing lasts forever, and therefore we get attached to it. We won’t think that one day we will go to the coffin. Therefore we go around the world trying to protect it-the thing lasting forever. For example, to live long, which is very important to Chinese, is like the fake shoes, because it diverts you from the truth. Therefore no matter what you do, you will suffer because you are wrong in the view. This is the reason that we don’t have fun, because we are caring for the impermanent. The view that everything is impermanent is not bad. Impermanence is good news. Today’s hand is not yesterday’s hand, if we get our hands dry, we use moisturizer. Without impermanence, moisturizer companies will have no business. Another example, if you are poor now, because of impermanence, you can get rich in the future. It is not a religious threat. In <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, monks have their head shaved. The shaving is to remind you of impermanence. It is ritual. Rituals are to take you to the truth, but we are caught by the rituals and forget impermanence. Like what I just said, why is there Buddhism? It is because we want to have fun.

We have emotions: love, hatred, jealousy, etc; all the emotions come from clinging to the self. This is a big discovery. Why? This is because we tend to blame some one else for our pains, but now we have no one to blame-we should only blame clinging to the self. This is a big subject. For example, we have the teaching of selflessness. However, Buddha didn’t find that the self is wrong, or clinging to the self is evil. This is not religious; this is only because the tools to contemplate selflessness have become religious. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

For example, we look at this table-it has legs, plank, etc; but the table is only those parts put together. Things put together, then it becomes something. For example, if I write 13 between 12 and 14 on a paper, you will say it is 13; if I write it between A and C, you will say it is B (</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">展示纸</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>). Everything is some things put together. If put another component, then it will become another thing. For example, if we put pillows, sheets on this table, it becomes a bed; if we cut it into pieces, it becomes firewood. Therefore the self is like 13 and B. We are seeking components put together. The Heart Sutra says </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">“</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>in emptiness there is no form, feeling, etc</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 宋体; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">”（心经：空中无色、受</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US>...) .

The self is always looking for a hiding place, something comfortable, insured, powerful, etc, such as money, power, influence and friendship, etc. If there is no self, there will be no economy. If people practice selflessness, market will crash. If there is no insecurity, there will be no business. I think this is the quintessence of business. We are seeking for what don’t have, but we think we should have. In order to make the non-existing self more comfortable, we are, on a large scale, destroying our world, such as the environment. On a small scale, for our friends and families, we say we love them, but only because we love ourselves. We put them on the self: every time you need them, you can use them. </FONT></SPAN></P>

To the couple, you can’t say “you will die finally” or “you will fight with each other some day in the future because you are human beings”.

If you see your boyfriend or girlfriend is very handsome or beautiful, you have to realize that most of other people would think they are ugly. The beauty or the ugliness is not there, empty of beauty and ugliness. So everything that appears is not what it is. So they must ask what is really there. We human being always like to ask these questions: what is really there? Okay, how it appears is not what it is. So in that case, what is there?

And that's probably what Mahayana people mostly do. But some Mahayana, especially the Vajrayana, then they say, if you have a master who can point out directly the experience of this emptiness, that is the best way! And this can come in the form of many things. I think the Zen people have some talk form. Anyway, conclusion: what you see or how it appears is not what it is.

Because what we've been talking about is basically the common ground for both Vajrayana and Mahayana. By the way, Vajrayana is Mahayana. I'd like to really tell you, without Hinayana, there is no Mahayana. Without these two, there is no Vajrayana. I know the Vajrayana is very ***y in some places. Many people forgot it is dangerous also. A classical example. If you have jaundice, and you are looking at a conch, you see it's yellow. I want to present you how Mahayana and Vajrayana deal with this. Mahayana and Hinayana, they say, look, you should eat this medicine. Your idea of yellow conch is wrong. You should eat medicine and get rid of that yellow conch. Now in the Vajrayana, they say it's a quick path. The reason why it's a quick path, they say it's because you bypass this thinking of yellow conch is wrong, I should eat medicine, so I can get rid of the yellow conch. They don't emphasize the yellow conch. Immediately, you begin to think it's white. Because it is white. You are seeing at a conch. You are seeing at a yellow because you have jaundice. Then think, think and think it's white. The reason why I want to tell you this is because Vajrayana has rituals. All rituals are about deity. All the deities from your self-reflection are like six-armed or something like that. The reason why we say is exactly why we talked about the yellow conch. Instead thinking I will become him, I am him or her! But this has been misused a lot.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US><FONT size=3>    Answer : Retreat has a lot of definitions. Basically you are supposed to build a boundary. There is an outer boundary such as I'm not going out of my room, out of my cave, or out of my monastery. Then you lock yourself in there for maybe one day, one year, one lifetime. Right? That's the only outer boundary. This kind of retreat is a sort of ordinary retreat. But the highest boundary you can make is between the past mind and the future mind. Being in the present! Even when you are bushing your teeth. That kind of retreat is the best.</FONT></SPAN></P>
